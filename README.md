## braindead-express-static-server

A simple static file server using express.js. The whole purpose of this stupid simple program to is to serve static files from a folder.

To use this program, put static
files in the `public/` folder. Then start the server using the following command:

`$ npm start`

By default, the server will start on port `3000`. To fetch your static file, open
your web browser and then do the following:

`http://localhost:3000/static.file.name`

For example:

`http://localhost:3000/index.html`
