A simple static file server using express.js. The whole purpose of this stupid simple program to is to serve static files from a folder.

## Installation:

If you don't already have express.js installed, then run the following command in the directory where you downloaded the source:

files in the `public/` folder. Then start the server using the following command:

By default, the server will start on port `3000`. To fetch your static file, open
your web browser and then do the following:
